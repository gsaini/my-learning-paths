# System Design Learning Path

This directory documents my journey through the System Design learning path. Here, I will collect resources, notes, and achievements as I build my understanding of designing scalable, reliable, and maintainable systems.

## About System Design

System design is a critical skill for software engineers, architects, and technical leaders. It involves designing the architecture of complex software systems, considering scalability, reliability, performance, security, and maintainability.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand core system design concepts and principles
- Learn to design scalable and distributed systems
- Explore common architectural patterns and trade-offs
- Practice designing real-world systems (e.g., URL shortener, messaging service, social network)
- Prepare for system design interviews
